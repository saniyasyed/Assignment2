# Partner: Jillian Anderson

# Note about partner: Jillian and I both worked on the assignment together on with very similar code, but submitted into our own GitHub repositories because we have our own working code.

# Note about outside help: Stephen White from another section in Data Structures met with us 2+ times to help us understand and work though some of the more complicated concepts of the game. He is a very helpful tutor.

# Also received help from Matt Raymond (the SI) and Daniel (the Data Structures tutor)
